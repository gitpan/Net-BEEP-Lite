	* lib/Net/BEEP/Lite/Session.pm (_read_frame): Add read timeouts

	sessions and prevent peers from getting wedged by framing errors.

2004-02-24  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* lib/Net/BEEP/Lite/Frame.pm (_parse_header): suppress
	"uninitialized value" warnings, from Matthew Darwin <matthew -at-

2003-09-11  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* renamed to Net::BEEP::Lite.

	* MgmtProfile.pm: better piggybacked data behavior: use
	BaseProfile::start_channel_request, plus <profile> replies get
	their data stowed in the session.  Also,
	send_start_channel_request return a tuple of (channel_number,
	message).

	* Session.pm (recv_message, _recv_message, _recv_frame): add named
	parameters to this chain of routines.  The only one so far is
	"NoSEQ" which will surpress SEQ generation by _recv_frame.

	* Session.pm (_tuning_reset): added.

	* BaseProfile.pm: renamed startChannelData to
	start_channel_request and changed the result semantics to a richer
	set of options.

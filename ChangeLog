	* lib/Net/BEEP/Lite/Session.pm (close_session): set the 'sock'
	member var. to undef to prevent calls to IO::Socket::is_connected
	after the the socket is known to be closed.

2003-10-06  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* lib/Net/BEEP/Lite.pm (_beep_listen_fork): Ignore SIGCHILDs
	[oops].
	

2003-09-11  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* renamed to Net::BEEP::Lite.

	* MgmtProfile.pm: better piggybacked data behavior: use
	BaseProfile::start_channel_request, plus <profile> replies get
	their data stowed in the session.  Also,
	send_start_channel_request return a tuple of (channel_number,
	message).

	* Session.pm (recv_message, _recv_message, _recv_frame): add named
	parameters to this chain of routines.  The only one so far is
	"NoSEQ" which will surpress SEQ generation by _recv_frame.

	* Session.pm (_tuning_reset): added.

	* BaseProfile.pm: renamed startChannelData to
	start_channel_request and changed the result semantics to a richer
	set of options.

2003-09-08  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* released version 0.01 (a beta release).

2003-08-27  David Blacka  <davidb@verisignlabs.com>

	* original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
